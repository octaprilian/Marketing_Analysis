## Project Overview 
  iFood, a company in the food retail sector, sells products in five major categories: wines, rare meat, exotic fruits, special fish, and sweet products. Within these categories, products are divided into gold and regular. The company operates through three sales channels: physical stores, catalogs, and the corporate website. Globally, the company has enjoyed healthy revenue in the last three years. However, looking at the growth prospects for the next three years, it appears unpromising. Therefore, strategic initiatives are needed to reverse this situation, including improving performance in the marketing domain with a focus on marketing campaigns.
